👋 Hello! I’m Jasper

👀 I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Glasgow, 
  primarily focused on learning Python with some experience in C++. 

🌱 My main interests lie in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, 
  particularly their applications in Financial Technology (FinTech).

💞️ This GitHub repository is where I document my learning journey and projects. 

😄 I’m excited to explore how data science and AI can shape the future of finance, and I’m continually building up my skills in these areas. Follow along to see my progress and feel free to connect with me!
